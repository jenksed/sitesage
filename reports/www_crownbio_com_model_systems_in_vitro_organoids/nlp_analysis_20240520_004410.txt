ORGANOIDS
Organoids for Oncology Drug Development
Preclinical oncology drug development and validation services using tumor organoids and the HUB tumor organoid biobank.

Progress Oncology Drug Development with Organoids Developed using HUB Protocols
  Make use of the great translatability of our 3D organoid models which show unprecedented patient response predictivity.
Benefit from faster development and enhanced scalability of organoids.
Model and mirror patient population diversity via screening multiple tumor organoid models simultaneously, and access both tumor and healthy organoids to evaluate in vitro data with clinically relevant drug potency and efficacy as well as off target effects.

FEATURES
APPLICATIONS
STUDY OPTIONS
Features
 Proprietary culture methods: Highly refined culture methods developed using Clevers Lab HUB’s protocols via exclusive partnerships, providing proprietary services
Varied indications: Multiple organoids available for over 20 organ and tissue types
Amenable to genetic perturbation via gene editing techniques such as RNA interference or CRISPR/Cas to identify and validate biological targets and discover mechanistic biomarkers
Maximizing the efficiency of the organoid platform with powerful imaging technology to penetrate the 3D structure and visualize the dynamic interplay of cells and their response to drug candidates.
  
Matched models: Paired in vitro PDXO and in vivo PDX models provide improved predictivity and a more rapid and informed study transition
Clinically relevant models:
Harnessing ASCs either directly from patients (PDOs) or from xenograft tissue (PDXOs) to recapitulate the complex architecture of in vivo tissue.
Unlimited expansion for large-scale screens
Living biobanks: Organoid database which includes light microscopy, genomic, transcriptomic, and pharmacology data

Integrated radiotherapy capabilities: Drug-Radiation combination testing using organoids
  Organoid Applications
Drug discovery and development:
Test candidate efficacy, safety, side effects, and pharmacokinetic properties as well as mechanism of action
Safety and toxicity studies: Evaluate safety and toxicity profiles using healthy organoids, developed from non-transformed cells
Personalized medicine: Leverage HUB OrganoidsTM as patient epitomes to design targeted and personalized therapies and stratify your patient population
Disease modeling: Capture disease relevance and patient population heterogeneity
Bridging in vitro and in vivo: Identify your target patient population before entering the clinical trails
Predictive biomarker identification: Determine potential biomarkers of therapeutic response with companion diagnostics
  Study Options
Preclinical oncology drug development and validation services using unique organoid models developed using IP-protected Hubrecht Organoid Technology (HUB) protocols, as well as HUB’s biobank of already established patient-derived organoids (PDOs)
Large-scale screens and drug radiation: Select models, and evaluate efficacy and multi-drug combination strategies
Efficacy and viability quantification: Identify responder and non-responder tumor models.
Leverage high content services to produce highly comprehensive morphology readouts in both 2D and 3D models.
Use multifactorial data for downstream lead ID and decision-making
HCI-based phenotype screening: Phenotypical screen up to thousands of compounds.
Layer and score drug effects with image mediated screens
Immunotherapy assessment: Benefit from the only immuno- oncology platform incorporating patient-relevant 3D in vitro models co-cultured with non-autologous immune cells
OrganoidXplore:
The first large-scale, panel based organoid screening service
